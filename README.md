Download or clone the repository to your computer.

Then run the command `npm install`

Then `npm install electron@latest -g`

After that try to run the app using `electron .` from the root folder of the app probably you'll endup with error. Please review that error and fix it if it's from your end.

Once that is fixed install electron-builder through `npm install electron-builder -g` and `npm install electron-builder --save-dev`.

Once completed with this run the electron-builder with `electron-builder -w` this is for windows.
